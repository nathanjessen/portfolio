# Portfolio

My personal website built with Next.js.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Directories

Some directories are created using GitHub pages in other repositories.

The website is built in my favourite Tech Stack and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for building React Components.
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployments and CI/CD.
* [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for deployment of docs.
* [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/)

## Issues

If you discover a bug, [report it here](https://github.com/nathanjessen/nathanjessen.github.com/issues) or even better, edit and send a pull-request with the fix.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

* [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
* [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
