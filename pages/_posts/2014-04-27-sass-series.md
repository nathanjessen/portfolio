For the last hour of every Wednesday at [VMLY&R](http://www.vmlyr.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a group of developers meet to discuss a wide variety of development topics. The group has been named Afternoon Tea but the meeting usually consists of a group of us sitting outside on the patio, drinking beers, and having a discussion on what we've been learning, reading, or experimenting with in development. Occasionally, we have planned talks on a specific book or technology.

Recently, I received recognition from coworkers as being one of the agency's CSS and Sass experts. My supervisor asked me to prepare a series of CSS/Sass talks for Afternoon Tea and I happily obliged. Below are links to slides I'm using as an outline for the talk.
